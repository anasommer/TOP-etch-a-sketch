// create divs using JS inside a container, grid 16 x 16
// have a fixed with, ex. 960 px for the grid
// use flexbox to make divs appear as a grid
// be careful of borders and margins
// set a hover effect so the divs change color when mouse passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail through the grid (add a new class to the div which will change its background)
// add a button to the top of the screen
// when button is clicked, ask user with a popup the number of squares per side for the new grid (set limit of max 100)
// when answer is provided, existing grid shoul be removed
// new grid should be generated
